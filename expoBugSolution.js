While a definitive solution requires further investigation by the Expo team, a potential workaround involves restarting the server.  You could create a script to automatically restart the server if it crashes.  This won't fix the underlying issue, but it will help keep development going.

Here's a basic example (requires Node.js and a process manager like PM2):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  expo start
  sleep 10  # Wait for a short period before restarting
done
```

This script continuously restarts `expo start`.  Note that this approach may not be ideal and the actual solution depends on the root cause of the crash.
